# Pig Game project

This is a simple game project that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is called Pig Game. The game is played by two players. The players take turns rolling a dice. The player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The player can hold their current score and add it to their total score. If the player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
